This project demonstrates the implementation of a Circular Queue using a singly linked list in C#.
The queue supports the following basic operations:

Enqueue: Add elements to the rear.

Dequeue: Remove elements from the front.

Peek: Show the element at the front.

Display: Print all elements in the queue in order.

The circular behavior is achieved by connecting the rear.next to the front, making the last node point to the beginning of the queue.
